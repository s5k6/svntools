The `pre-commit` bash-script can be installed on the SVN server to
limit the files that can be added to the repository based on

    * size

    * file name suffix

    * characters used in filenames

Further configuration can be put in `pre-commit.config` which is
sourced from the hook script.  Individual users and paths in the repo
can be “privileged”, i.e., exempt from some of the limitations imposed
by the script.

I've used this script for a rather strict regime in the inf2_16s
lecture: Only plain text files (program source code, theoretical
solutions in plain text or latex source code) limited to 64kiB are
allowed.  Many file types (*.aux, *.log, ...) are forbidden.  File
names must contain neither umlauts nor spaces.

There have been no complaints by the students.  I did not see any
problems one might expect with using different platforms (and
differing encoding of umlauts, as combining or single characters), and
the tutors have been happy.
